	https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

Setup
========
Go into the folder MpegDashServerFramework/target and run the following command:
```
java -jar mpeg-dash-server-framework-1.0.0-shaded.jar -setup -ip <insert your ip here>
```

[this will setup the docker image for launching video feeds]
		
There is an example configuration file located in MpegDashServerFramework/src/main/resources/servers
This is where you will setup parameters for encoding the video into MPEG-DASH format, as well as specifying the video name, port, and 
	[ip address of video to encode and stream, OR a video file name of the file located in node-gpac-dash folder. (you must place the file there OR use the client to upload the video)]


Running the server
=======
Go into the SeniorProject201516/node-gpac-dash folder and input the following command:
```
wget https://download.blender.org/durian/trailer/sintel_trailer-480p.mp4
```
This will retrieve the sample video that the configuration examples are setup to use.

Now that the docker image is setup and you have the videofile, you can run the server with the following command:
```
java -jar mpeg-dash-server-framework-1.0.0-shaded.jar -ip <insert your ip here>
```



[optional parameter '-autolaunch false' -default true, if set to false the program will launch with the videos DISABLED]
